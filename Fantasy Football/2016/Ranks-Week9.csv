I found this interesting. This is what I used for the luck index. It's a chart of how likely you are to have a certain number of wins or more given a random schedule
e.g. Sherwin would always have at least 1 win because he was the highest scorer week 1. So no matter what schedule we choose' Sherwin gets at least one win. Each column is every teams probability of having at least the number of wins of that column if we replayed the season with a randomzied schedule.
