<p>BACKGROUND:<br>
Primary cardiac involvement is uncommon in ALS. Reported here are 3 cases where patients developed cardiac disease including the first case of Brugada syndrome reported in ALS. 
<br><br>CASE REPORTS:<br>
(1) Brugada syndrome: A 45-year-old woman presented with right upper limb weakness and fasciculations and was diagnosed with ALS. She was wheelchair bound and had developed bulbar symptoms when she presented with sudden onset shortness of breath. CT of the chest did not show pneumonia; CT angiogram of chest did not show pulmonary embolus. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed pronounced elevation of the J point, a coved-type ST segment, and an inverted T wave in V1 and V2 diagnostic of Brugada syndrome. Extensive workup for reversible causes was nondiagnostic. (2) Dilated cardiomyopathy: A 70-year-old man presented with lower limb weakness and was wheelchair bound before he was diagnosed with ALS. Three months later he presented with sudden onset shortness of breath. CT of the chest showed pulmonary edema; CT angiogram did not show pulmonary embolus. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with dilated left ventricular cavity. Extensive workup for reversible causes was nondiagnostic. (3) Atrial fibrillation: A 62-year-old woman presented with slurred speech and difficulty in swallowing and was a diagnosed with ALS. Two months after diagnosis she presented with sudden onset shortness of breath. CT/angiogram of the chest was normal. EKG revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. She was treated with IV sotalol and placed on digoxin treatment. 
<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br>
While pulmonary issues are a common cause of dyspnea in ALS, cardiac involvement can be a potentially life threatening presentation.
